## Key directories:
- spec/
  Design spec, describes how the language works
- hwcCompile/
  Contains the source for the compiler
- hwcSim/
  Simulator, planned to eventually use ncurses to display colored/manipulated source code as a quasi-GUI
- hwcSim_raw/
  Simulator with non-ncurses output.  Not suitable for human consumption, except for experts; used for running unit tests.  (This shares all code, except for the output code, with hwcSim/
- wiring/, graph/, sim/
  Directories containing code that is shared across two or more tools
