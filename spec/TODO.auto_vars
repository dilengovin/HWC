Allow 'auto' variable declarations:
    auto x = y;



If we eventually implement return-tuple functions, then we could go one step
further.  This would be a basic return-tuple use case:
    bit[4] x;
    Data   y;
    (x,y) = SomeFunc();
and this would be an auto version:
    (auto x,auto y) = SomeFunc();
